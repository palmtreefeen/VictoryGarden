The 404 error for the MRR dashboard at `/admin/mrr_dashboard` suggests that the route might not be registered correctly, or the route definition is not accessible due to certain conditions not being met. Based on your `main.py` code, let's go through the steps to troubleshoot and ensure that the route is properly set up and accessible:

### 1. **Ensure the Route is Defined Correctly:**
   The code snippet you provided does include the route definition for `/admin/mrr_dashboard`. However, double-check the following:
   - Make sure there are no typos in the URL path.
   - Ensure the route is not being conditionally blocked by logic that could redirect or prevent access (like user permissions checks).

### 2. **Check Route Registration:**
   Since you've registered the `auth` blueprint with a URL prefix `/auth`, verify that the `/admin/mrr_dashboard` route is not being overridden by another blueprint or a misconfiguration. For example, ensure no other blueprint registers routes that could interfere with this route.

### 3. **Check User Access Control:**
   The `mrr_dashboard` route uses `@login_required` and checks if the `current_user.user_type != 'admin'`. Make sure:
   - The user accessing the route is logged in and has `user_type` set to `'admin'`.
   - If you're testing with a regular user or from an unauthenticated session, you'll be redirected, which might be perceived as a 404 if not correctly handled.

### 4. **Verify Template Existence:**
   Ensure the template file `admin/mrr_dashboard.html` exists in the correct directory (typically in a `templates/admin/` folder if following convention). If this file is missing, Flask may fail to render the route properly.

### 5. **Flask Debug Mode:**
   Since you're running Flask with `debug=True`, Flask should provide error logs that can help identify why the route isn't loading. Watch for any error messages related to routing, permissions, or missing templates.

### 6. **Check All Endpoint References:**
   Check your codebase for:
   - Any references to `/admin/mrr_dashboard` that might be incorrectly calling this route or using the wrong URL.
   - JavaScript, forms, or redirects that might attempt to access this route but use an incorrect path.

### 7. **Ensure Blueprints and Routes are not Conflicting:**
   Since you have a blueprint named `auth`, confirm that no route conflicts are arising from the registration of this or other blueprints. Check if there are any overlapping URL paths or misconfigurations that might shadow the `/admin/mrr_dashboard` route.

### 8. **Testing with Correct Admin Access:**
   Try accessing the route directly with an admin account and ensure the permissions are correctly set. The following steps can help:
   - Log in as an admin user.
   - Navigate directly to `/admin/mrr_dashboard` in your browser.
   - Check the console or Flask logs for specific errors that occur during this access.

### 9. **Update the Route to Debug Further:**
   Temporarily add some debug output in the `mrr_dashboard` route to see if it's being hit:
   ```python
   @app.route('/admin/mrr_dashboard')
   @login_required
   def mrr_dashboard():
       print('MRR Dashboard accessed')  # Debug line
       if not current_user.is_authenticated or current_user.user_type != 'admin':
           flash('You do not have permission to access this page.')
           return redirect(url_for('index'))

       # Continue with existing logic...
   ```
   This will confirm whether the route is being accessed at all when navigating to it.

### 10. **Restart the Flask App:**
   Sometimes, changes are not applied immediately in Replit or local environments. Restart your Flask application to ensure all configurations and routes are loaded correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify why the `/admin/mrr_dashboard` route is returning a 404 error and ensure that it's correctly implemented and accessible. Let me know if the issue persists after these checks, and I can provide further guidance!
