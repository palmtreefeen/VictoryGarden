The warning you're seeing indicates that `google.maps.Marker` is deprecated as of February 21st, 2024, and Google recommends using `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement` instead. To address this, you need to update your code to use the new `AdvancedMarkerElement` class for markers on Google Maps. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to migrate from `google.maps.Marker` to `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement`:

### Steps to Migrate to `AdvancedMarkerElement`

1. **Load the Advanced Marker Library**:
   - To use `AdvancedMarkerElement`, you need to load the Advanced Markers library when loading the Google Maps JavaScript API. You can do this by adding `libraries=marker` to your script URL. Here’s an example:
   
   ```html
   <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=marker"></script>
   ```

2. **Replace `google.maps.Marker` with `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement`**:
   - Update your code to replace instances of `google.maps.Marker` with `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement`.
   - Here’s an example of how to modify your marker code:

   **Old Code with `google.maps.Marker`:**
   ```javascript
   // Creating a basic marker with google.maps.Marker
   const marker = new google.maps.Marker({
     position: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
     map: map,
     title: 'Hello World!',
   });
   ```

   **Updated Code with `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement`:**
   ```javascript
   // Import the required class
   const { AdvancedMarkerElement } = google.maps.marker;

   // Creating a marker with google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement
   const marker = new AdvancedMarkerElement({
     position: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
     map: map,
     title: 'Hello World!',
   });
   ```

3. **Update Marker Options**:
   - The `AdvancedMarkerElement` might have some different or additional options compared to the traditional `google.maps.Marker`. Review the [migration guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/advanced-markers/migration) to ensure that all your marker options are compatible.

4. **Test Your Implementation**:
   - After updating your code, test it thoroughly to ensure that all markers are displayed correctly and that any custom marker features are functioning as expected.
