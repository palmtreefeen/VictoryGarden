Based on the provided `models.py` code, your `User` model is correctly defined, with methods for handling subscriptions and calculating MRR. However, it seems the `Subscription` model might be missing, as this can cause issues with the Flask application startup, especially if the application logic relies on it.

### Adding the `Subscription` Model

If the `Subscription` model is expected to be part of your application and currently missing, hereâ€™s a basic definition you can add to `models.py`:

```python
class Subscription(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'subscriptions'
    
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    duration_months = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)  # Duration of the subscription in months
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
    
    # Optional relationships if linked to users or transactions
    # user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    # transactions = db.relationship('Transaction', backref='subscription', lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Subscription {self.name} - ${self.price}>'
```

### Steps to Add or Restore the Subscription Model

1. **Add the Subscription Model:** Copy the above model code into your `models.py` file beneath the `User` model.
   
2. **Save the Changes:** Ensure the file is saved after adding the model.

3. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   - **Initialize Migrations:** If this is the first migration, you may need to initialize with:
     ```bash
     flask db init
     ```
   - **Create the Migration:** Generate a migration file to add the `Subscription` table.
     ```bash
     flask db migrate -m "Add Subscription model"
     ```
   - **Upgrade the Database:** Apply the migration to update the database schema.
     ```bash
     flask db upgrade
     ```

4. **Restart Your Flask Application:**
   - Restart your application to ensure it starts correctly with the updated models.
   - Check for any startup errors and resolve them as necessary.

### Verify the Application Functionality

- **Check Routes and Features:** Make sure that routes or features dependent on the `Subscription` model work as expected.
- **Test Subscription Management:** Test creating, updating, and viewing subscriptions to ensure the model functions correctly with your application logic.

If everything is added correctly and your application starts up without errors, the `Subscription` model should now be correctly integrated into your Flask application. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!
